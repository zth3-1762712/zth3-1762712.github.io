Since that time, we have performed for schools and civic organizations and at college and professional sporting events. We are a demonstration team for the American Heart Association, and we perform at schools and community events to promote the “Jump Rope for Heart” program. The team has been featured on dozens of local, national, and international television shows, including Good Morning America, The Ellen Show, The Tonight Show, Sesame Street, Bill Nye the Science Guy, Young Universe, Nickelodeon’s “Figure It Out,” ESPN’s coverage of the National Championship, Evening Magazine, Sabado Gigante, and Good Morning Australia. Our jumpers have traveled worldwide to promote the sport of jump rope, including to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Japan, China, Korea, Mexico, Costa Rica, Ecuador, South Africa, England, France, Germany, Belgium, Cyprus, Kenya, Tanzania, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bermuda, Spain, and Israel. Members of our group have performed several times with the world-renowned “Cirque du Soleil” and “Cirque Dreams” performing groups, and a group of our jumpers even performed several times at the 2012 Olympic Games in London! We are also recognized as one of the top competitive teams in the world, and each year we participate in local, regional, national and international competitions. We have taken home numerous National, Grand National, and World Championship titles.</blockquote>
